\chapter{Evaluation}
The last chapter of our thesis presents an evaluation of all conducted experiments, described in detail in Chapter \ref{sec:medGenReportExperiments}, for medical reports generation task. Each performed experiment is evaluated automatically with the common machine translation metrics. Furthermore, the outputs of the best model were manually evaluated by an experienced radiologist. The evaluation outputs of all models are included in Attachement TODO.

\section{Automatic evaluation}
First part of this chapter shows the results of the automatic evaluation of our trained models. Important thing to mention is that these metrics give us only an indication of which models could be theoretically perfoming good and not their true performance. This fact is further intensified by the nature of our area, where we need to capture all findings appearing in the image and the overall diagnosis. \\

The evaluation was performed on a subset of 500 X-ray images. We subjected all models to standard automatic evaluation metrics used in image captioning and machine translation areas using NLG evaluation from \citet{sharma2017nlgeval}.
