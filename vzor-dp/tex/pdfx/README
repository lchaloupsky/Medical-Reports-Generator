Readme for pdfx package (pdfx.sty)

pdfx.sty is a LaTeX package which helps to create PDF/X and
PFD/A, PDF/E and PDF/VT compliant PDF documents with pdfTeX.

Installation:

Create a directory $TEXMF/tex/latex/pdfx and copy pdfx.sty, *.xmp,
*.icc, *.def and glyphtounicode-cmr.tex to this directory.  Update
the file database of your TeX system.

Documentation:

Composite documentation and code is available in src/pdfx.dtx. Run
TeX/LaTeX on pdfx.ins to extract pdfx.sty from pdfx.dtx.  If you
[pdf]LaTeX pdfx.dtx, you will get pdfx.pdf which is the human readable
documentation.

'make all' does all the above, as a single command-line call.

LINKS in the pdf document.
